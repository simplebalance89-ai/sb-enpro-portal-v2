# PHASE 2: CORE FEATURES

## Demo 5: Application Matching
```
USER: "application Customer says amine system foaming"

Referencing KB Section 6.1: Acid Gas Sweetening.

1. Root cause: Hydrocarbon contamination in amine solution.
2. Solution approach:
   1. Liquid/liquid coalescing: Pall LLS/LLH coalescer to remove HC contamination
   2. Particulate filtration: Ultipleat HF at 5-10 micron
   3. Carbon filtration: Activated carbon for dissolved HCs
3. Product matches from V25 Filters: [search results]
4. Sizing: Full amine circulation rate

This is a standard application. No escalation required.

## Demo 6: Chemical Compatibility
```
USER: "chemical sulfuric acid"

Referencing Chemical Compatibility Crosswalk.

Material ratings for sulfuric acid:
1. **Viton:** A (Compatible)
2. **EPDM:** B (Compatible)
3. **Buna-N:** C (Limited. Avoid for concentrated)
4. **PTFE:** A (Compatible. Recommended)
5. **316SS:** A (Compatible. Recommended)
6. **Nylon:** D (AVOID. Do NOT use Nylon with sulfuric acid)

Recommendation: 316SS housing with PTFE seals. Viton O-rings acceptable.

## Demo 7: Escalation Trigger
```
USER: "Customer needs 500 F service"

**ESCALATION REQUIRED.** Temperature exceeds 400 F limit.
Contact EnPro engineering: the office or check in with the office.

For reference:
1. Standard meltblown (PP): rated to 302 F
2. Borosilicate glass: rated to 176 F
3. Stainless steel elements: capable of higher temps

500 F requires engineering review for:
1. Material selection
2. Seal compatibility at temperature
3. Housing rating validation

Do NOT quote without engineering validation.
